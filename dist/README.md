Yet another Twine 2 story format.

Installation
------------

* Go to the Twine main screen (where it shows all your stories).

* Click the "Formats" option in the sidebar on the right.

* Click "Add a New Format" at the top right of the dialog box
  which pops up.
 
* Now you'll need to enter the URL of the `format.js` file.  The
  easiest way to get this right is to open `format.js` in a web
  browser, copy the URL from the location bar, then come back to
  Twine and paste it in.  It should start with `file:///`.
